# Nextcloud MCP Server

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-ghcr.io/cbcoutinho/nextcloud--mcp--server-blue)](https://github.com/cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server/pkgs/container/nextcloud-mcp-server)

**A production-ready MCP server that connects AI assistants to your Nextcloud instance.**

Enable Large Language Models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini to interact with your Nextcloud data through a secure API. Create notes, manage calendars, organize contacts, work with files, and more - all through natural language conversations.

This is a **dedicated standalone MCP server** designed for external MCP clients like Claude Code and IDEs. It runs independently of Nextcloud (Docker, VM, Kubernetes, or local) and provides deep CRUD operations across Nextcloud apps.

> [!NOTE]
> **Looking for AI features inside Nextcloud?** Nextcloud also provides [Context Agent](https://github.com/nextcloud/context_agent), which powers the Assistant app and runs as an ExApp inside Nextcloud. See [docs/comparison-context-agent.md](docs/comparison-context-agent.md) for a detailed comparison of use cases.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server) - no Docker or self-hosting required:

1. Visit the [Smithery marketplace page](https://smithery.ai/server/@cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server)
2. Click "Deploy" and configure:
   - **Nextcloud URL**: Your Nextcloud instance (e.g., `https://cloud.example.com`)
   - **Username**: Your Nextcloud username
   - **App Password**: Generate one in Nextcloud → Settings → Security → Devices & sessions

> [!NOTE]
> Smithery runs in stateless mode without semantic search. For full features, use [Docker](#docker-self-hosted) or see [ADR-016](docs/ADR-016-smithery-stateless-deployment.md).

## Docker (Self-Hosted)

For full features including semantic search, run with Docker:

```bash
# 1. Create a minimal configuration
cat > .env << EOF
NEXTCLOUD_HOST=https://your.nextcloud.instance.com
NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=your_username
NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EOF

# 2. Start the server
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 --env-file .env --rm \
  ghcr.io/cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server:latest

# 3. Test the connection
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/ready

# 4. Connect to the endpoint
http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse

# Or with --transport streamable-http
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

**Docker Compose Profiles** (for development/testing):

```bash
docker compose --profile single-user up -d       # Port 8000
docker compose --profile multi-user-basic up -d   # Port 8003
docker compose --profile oauth up -d              # Port 8001
docker compose --profile login-flow up -d         # Port 8004
```

**Next Steps:**
- Connect your MCP client (Claude Desktop, IDEs, `mcp dev`, etc.)
- See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for other deployment options (local, Kubernetes)

## Authentication

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **OAuth2/OIDC is experimental** and requires a manual patch to the `user_oidc` app:
> - **Required patch**: Bearer token support ([issue #1221](https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/issues/1221))
> - **Impact**: Without the patch, most app-specific APIs fail with 401 errors
> - **Recommendation**: Use Basic Auth for production until upstream patches are merged
>
> See [docs/oauth-upstream-status.md](docs/oauth-upstream-status.md) for patch status and workarounds.

**Recommended:** Basic Auth with app-specific passwords provides secure, production-ready authentication. See [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md) for setup details and OAuth configuration.

### Authentication Modes

The server supports four authentication modes:

**Single-User (BasicAuth):**
- One set of credentials shared by all MCP clients
- Simple setup: username + app password in environment variables
- All clients access Nextcloud as the same user
- Best for: Personal use, development, single-user deployments

**Multi-User (BasicAuth Pass-Through):**
- MCP clients send credentials via Authorization header
- Server passes through to Nextcloud (stateless by default)
- Optional per-user scope restrictions via `BASIC_AUTH_SCOPES_<USERNAME>` env vars
- Optional offline access for background operations (`ENABLE_MULTI_USER_BASIC_AUTH=true`)
- Best for: Multi-user setups without OAuth infrastructure

**Multi-User (Bearer Token):**
- Pre-configured tokens map to Nextcloud accounts with per-token scopes
- Multiple clients can share one NC account with different permissions
- Clients authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Works alongside BasicAuth (both modes active simultaneously)
- Best for: Multiple LLM clients on the same NC account with different access levels

**Multi-User (OAuth):**
- Each MCP client authenticates separately with their own Nextcloud account
- Per-user scopes and permissions (clients only see tools they're authorized for)
- More secure: tokens expire, credentials never shared with server
- Best for: Teams, multi-user deployments, production environments with multiple users
- Requires: Patches to the `user_oidc` app (experimental)

**Multi-User (Login Flow v2):**
- Uses Nextcloud's native Login Flow v2 to obtain per-user app passwords
- No OAuth patches required — works with stock Nextcloud
- Each user authenticates via browser, server manages app passwords
- Best for: Multi-user deployments without OAuth infrastructure (`ENABLE_LOGIN_FLOW=true`)
- Experimental: See [ADR-022](docs/ADR-022-deployment-mode-consolidation.md) for details

See [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Semantic Search

The server provides an experimental RAG pipeline to enable _Semantic Search_ that enables MCP clients to find information in Nextcloud based on **meaning** rather than just keywords. Instead of matching "machine learning" only when those exact words appear, it understands that "neural networks," "AI models," and "deep learning" are semantically related concepts.

**Example:**
- **Keyword search**: Query "car" only finds notes containing "car"
- **Semantic search**: Query "car" also finds notes about "automobile," "vehicle," "sedan," "transportation"

This enables natural language queries and helps discover related content across your Nextcloud notes.

> [!NOTE]
> **Semantic Search is experimental and opt-in:**
> - Disabled by default (`ENABLE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH=false`)
> - Currently supports Notes app only (multi-app support planned)
> - Requires additional infrastructure: vector database + embedding service
> - Answer generation (`nc_semantic_search_answer`) requires MCP client sampling support
>
> See [docs/semantic-search-architecture.md](docs/semantic-search-architecture.md) for architecture details and [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for setup instructions.
